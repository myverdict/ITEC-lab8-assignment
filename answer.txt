"Property or method ... is not defined on the instance but referenced during render."

Question: What does this Vue warning message mean?,
          Can you safely ignore it?, What causes it?, and How do you fix it?

Answer: This Vue warning message means that you are using a variable, "total", in the template that
        does not exist in the Vue data. This warning should be fixed and cannot be ignored. This error
        is caused because there is no "total" property defined in the Vue data or any where else in the
        Vue object.

Fix: If variable definition is given, then check the variable, "total", spelling.<br>
     If variable definition is not given, then create a new variable named "total.
